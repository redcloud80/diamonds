Game Details:
-------------
Diamond Crush is a classic puzzle game, with both single player and multiplayer game
modes. This First Playable Version is multiplayer-based, and offers only offline single
matches for two players at a time.
Both players will control falling pairs of differently colored and shaped gems, and
their purpose will be strategically placing them inside their own grid-based play fields,
by matching their colors. Building up rectangles composed by many gems of the same color
will make them turn into agglomerates, bigger gems whose score values change according
to their size.
Some colored treasure boxes, falling together with the gems, will allow the players to
delete all the adjacent gems of the same color, preventing their play fields to fill up
completely (this event would lead to a Game Over). Any other gem placed above the cells
whose content has got deleted will fall down, filling up them. This event can trigger
chain reactions (Crushes) if any gem falls over a chest of the same color, or vice versa.
Deletions and Crushes, according to the number of deleted gems, will make a different
number of stones, whose fall scheme follows some strict patterns and who turn into gems
after some turns, fall into the opponent's play field, filling up his grid and making
his strategies harder to accomplish. This feature encourages both players to try to
build up longer Crushes and bigger agglomerates: a strategic approach towards this
objective is the key to win a game.

Known Problems/Bugs:
--------------------
- On some GNU/Linux systems the game refuses to start because our libraries rely to an
  old version of libtiff. If you have a newer version of this library installed, you can
  start the game by creating a symbolic link like in this example:
  # ln -s /usr/lib/libtiff.so.4 /usr/lib/libtiff.so.3
- Under GNU/Linux systems with amd 64 and xfree as x server, the game may not run.
- Iconising the game window might cause slight visualization flaws in certain graphics elements.
- On some Windows configurations (Win2000/Win98), the DiamondCrush.exe file might not work. 
  If this happens onto your PC, use run-diamonds.bat to launch the game anyway.
- Making too many Stones fall could not trigger a Game Over, even if the opponent's play
  field is totally full.
- To solve audio related problems on linux just follow this easy steps:
    1. Copy the files openalrc.example and asoundrc.example from the docs
       directory to you home directory.
    2. rename "openalrc.example" to ".openalrc"
    3. rename "asoundrc.example" to ".asoundrc"
